# Installation

```
npm install --save j-list
```

## Use

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import jList from 'j-list'

Vue.use(jList)
```


## Use it in another project

While developping, you can follow the install instructions of your plugin and link it into the project that uses it.

In the plugin folder:

```
npm link
```

In the other project folder:

```
npm link j-list
```

This will install it in the dependencies as a symlink, so that it gets any modifications made to the plugin.

## Publish to npm

You may have to login to npm before, with `npm adduser`. The plugin will be built in production mode before getting published on npm.

```
npm publish
```

## Manual build

This will build the plugin into the `dist` folder in production mode.

```
npm run build
```
